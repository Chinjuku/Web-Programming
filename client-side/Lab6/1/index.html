            <p>A programming language is a formal language which comprises a set of Instructions
                used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to create
                programs that implement specific algorithms.

                <p>C is a general-purpose imperative computer programming, lexical
                    variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents
                    many unintended operations.

                    object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation 
                    dependencies as possible.
